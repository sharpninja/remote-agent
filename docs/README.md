# Remote Agent — Documentation

This folder contains requirements and design documents derived from the **recovered Project Initializer session** (Cursor chat).

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [**Functional requirements**](functional-requirements.md) | What the product must do: product purpose, chat behavior, message priority and notifications, archive, UI and presentation, deployment from a user perspective, session lifecycle. |
| [**Technical requirements**](technical-requirements.md) | How it must be built: solution and repo, technology stack, service and app architecture, gRPC protocol, Docker, CI/CD, testing, UI and assets. |

Both documents were filled using the user messages recovered from the crashed session (see root [RECOVERED_INPUT.md](../RECOVERED_INPUT.md) for the raw recovered text). Requirements are written as numbered statements (FR-* / TR-*) for traceability.
